# Anti-Money-Laundering-anomalies-detection-using-time-series-and-machine-learning-algorithms

This is a project made for testing and researching on the dataset of the laundered money. This project has later on been extended for research paper purpose. In this project, we first implement time series and then we use many ML algorithms such as XGBoost and others. We have implemented a autoencoder in this project in order to improve the accuracy and to determine if the accuracy is improved.

Same algorithms are checked later on for the same ML algorithms for the research.
